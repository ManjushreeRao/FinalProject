<h5 class="display-6 "><strong>NJIT To Host Community COVID-19 Vaccination Center</strong></h5>
<p class="lead">New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is pleased to announce our partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the New Jersey Office of the Governor, the Department of Defense (DoD), the New Jersey State Police (NJSP), the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and other agencies to open a new COVID Community Vaccination Center on the NJIT campus. The Naimoli Center on NJIT's campus in Newark, N.J. will serve as the hub for vaccine activity at the new COVID Community Vaccination Center. NJIT is working aggressively to prepare for the coming launch of this important initiative on Wednesday, March 31. This center is expected to deploy up to 6,000 doses of vaccine per day and will help save lives, aid in our local and statewide recovery efforts, and expedite our return to normalcy. NJIT is exceptionally proud to be part of this effort and is appreciative of President Biden, Governor Murphy, and the federal and state agencies that are collaborating with NJIT to make this possible and to get this center up and running expeditiously.</p>

<p class="lead">NJIT specifically selected the Naimoli Center location for vaccine distribution in order to minimize the potential impact on our campus community by keeping traffic to the vaccination center on the perimeter of campus. NJIT is also establishing procedures and protocols designed to prevent the operations of the vaccination center from encroaching upon the majority of our campus or significantly disrupting daily life at NJIT.</p>

<p class="lead">The vaccine center is scheduled to be open through at least May 31, and it is anticipated that, once fully open, the vaccination center will be operational seven days a week.</p>

<p class="lead">NJIT is proud to be part of this important effort to increase vaccine access throughout our region, which will help expedite our recovery and will save lives in our community. Thank you all for your support, cooperation, and patience as NJIT embarks upon this massive and essential undertaking.</p>
